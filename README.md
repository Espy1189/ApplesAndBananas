# ApplesAndBananas

Apples and Bananas is a very simple and fun (console interface) word game, based off of Bulls and Cows and the more recent
and popular Mastermind, coded in C++.
Apples and Bananas is a game where a player guesses a word isogram generated by the application. Depending on the word length the user receives a set amount of tries to guess the word. The helper system to figure out the word is qualified as follows:

   - A player receives a "Apple" if a letter of the guessed word appears in the same position as it appears in the original word.
   - A player receives a "Banana" if a letter of the guessed word appears in a different position then it appears in the original word.

 The game continues until the player guesses the word correctly or runs out of tries.
